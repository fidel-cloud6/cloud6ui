                Containerized proprietary simulators across isolated AWS accounts using AWS Organizations, enabling
                secure, on-demand environments for each customer. This architecture allows for rapid provisioning
                triggered by user registration and approval, giving clients immediate access to production-like systems
                for testing and validating telemetry data. The isolated deployments ensure strict account-level
                separation, supporting customer data privacy and compliance while accelerating onboarding and
                integration workflows.

                Developed a secure, vision-based analytics system using IoT devices and radio-connected cameras to
                capture and encrypt real-time images of pallet jack operations. Images are streamed to the cloud, where
                AWS AI/ML services analyze pallet and site contents. The solution features end-to-end security and
                role-based access, ensuring data integrity and privacy. It enhances visibility, reduces losses, improves
                traceability, and supports deliveries by verifying loads in transit and upon arrival. This scalable
                architecture combines edge computing with cloud AI to optimize both warehouse and field logistics.
